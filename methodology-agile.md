### Methodology Agile x Waterfall 

Definitively, the test strategy would change if the methodology changes. 
In the waterfall methodology the testing is typically performed after the entire system or large part of it has been developed, that means that, the tests would run after the phase 1 of our project has been developed, so the testing would be done in bulk, at the end of the development phase 1, and then wait for the development of the phase 2 to continue the testing. This can lead to a large volume of defects, which may be more complex and take more time to fix. As well as, the testing process is more rigid and less adaptative to change. 
The agile methodology is more iterative, flexible and continuous approach. I could adapt my test strategy for the E-store project taking in considerations that the requirements would be divided into smaller iterations or sprints. Therefore, my changes would be:
-	The test plans would be created for each iteration based on features;
-	Test automation to be run quickly and often;
-	Automate regression testing to ensure that news changes would not break the existing functionalities;
-	Tests would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so they would run automatically with each code change;
-	Would reviews and retrospectives to ensure the effectiveness of the testing process;
-	Would adapt the testing strategy based on feedback from the previous iterations;
